## Overview
This project uses Sentinel-1 radar data and nighttime light data to estimate building heights using a deep learning model (U-Net). The generated height maps contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 11 (sustainable cities).

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohammadkakooei/Building_Height.git
cd building-heights
pip install -r requirements.txt
